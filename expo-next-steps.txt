Next steps:
------------
1. If you have separate index.ios.js and index.android.js files, you'll need to create a main.js file that contains `require('./index');`. Also set `"main": "main.js"` in package.json.
2. Find your AppRegistry.registerComponent('YourApplicationName', () => YourRootComponent) call and replace it with Expo.registerRootComponent(YourRootComponent) (you will need to import Expo from 'expo').
3. Upload your app icon somewhere on the web and add it the newly created exp.json file, in the iconUrl and loading.iconUrl fields.
4. Delete your 'android' and 'ios' directories if you have them -- you no longer need to compile any native code to run your app.
5. Resolve any issues with potentially incompatible packages: 

** react-native-maps: Expo provides react-native-maps for you. You can use it with "import { Components } from 'expo';" and <Components.Map /> in your render function.
** This may not be an exhaustive list of packages you will need to address -- any package that has a native code dependency will need to be converted to an Expo equivalent or removed. Refer to the SDK API reference here: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/index.html
6. Open your app in XDE and run it, fix bugs as they arise.
